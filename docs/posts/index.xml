      <title>Controlling a Motor with the Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>My first objective was to get the motor to start feeding out a single card from a stack of cards. I created a quick chassis that would allow me to load a hopper of cards and feed out cards from the bottom.
Connecting the Pi to a Motor As my first test, I got a few cheap 28YBJ-48 Stepper Motors, which I figured would give me a good amount of control as you can control the steps quite accurately.</description>

      <title>What is MagicLoadr?</title>

      <description>MagicLoadr is an automatic machine that takes standard size cards (MtG cards, for example) and inserts them into penny sleeves, and then into a toploader. The goal is to be able to process thousands of cards without supervision.
MagicLoadr is a project that I started in Jan 2018 after I purchased my first Raspberry Pi and was trying to figure out what to do with it. I love automation and both my businesses (Rinuu &amp;amp; AZLabels) are 95% automated.</description>
