MagicLoadr is an automatic machine that takes standard size cards (MtG cards, for example) and inserts them into penny sleeves, and then into a toploader. The goal is to be able to process thousands of cards without supervision.

MagicLoadr is a project that I started in Jan 2018 after I purchased my first Raspberry Pi and was trying to figure out what to do with it. I enjoy automation and both my businesses (Rinuu & AZLabels) are 95% automated. All my automation up until this point has been in the digital world, so this is my first foray into automating physical processes.

I started this blog very shortly after starting this process, as I realized there is very little information online about DIY physical automation. Most of what I needed to know I had to glean from information about robots, and so I thought there would be some value in documenting what I learned along the way, as the field of DIY automation is probably interesting to others as well.

My ultimate goal with the project is to 1) start a CCG shop that is able to automatically list available cards and fulfill them when an order is placed; 2) launch a consumer version of MagicLoadr on Kickstarter. If that is not viable, then 3) offer card protection as a service (people send in a box of cards, they are returned in toploaders). There may be other applications I discover along the way that I havenâ€™t thought of yet.

Thanks for following along!
